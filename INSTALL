Prerequisites
=============

To compile aardview you need Qt (http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/)
version 4.3 or newer. On an average Linux distribution you'll need to
install packages for qmake, uic, and headers. For debian, that would be
at least qt4-qmake and libqt4-dev


Compiling
=========

Change to the aardview toplevel directory (i.e. the one with this file in)
and execute qmake (qmake-qt4, in case default qmake on your system is from
qt3). After that, just type make. 


Install
=======

The binary (aardview/aardview) is currently self-contained, just copy it to
wherever you like. An install routine will be provided once there are external
dependencies.
